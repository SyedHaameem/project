Sooo okay 16:18:40 today's Computer Architecture lecture.
        It defines how hardware + software interact to run instructions.
        It has ISA, microarchitecture, system architecture.
        ISA → instructions, registers, addressing modes.
        RISC (ARM, RISC-V) vs CISC (x86).
        Microarchitecture = ALU, control unit, caching, pipeline, branch prediction, superscalar stuff.
        Kinda complicated 🤦‍♂️ but important.
