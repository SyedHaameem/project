Okay sooo, 10:03:07, today's lecture is on Operating Systems (OS).
        OS acts as, umm... a bridge between user + hardware.
        Responsibilities: process mgmt, memory mgmt, file mgmt, device control… all that stuff.
        SJF, FCFS, Priority, Round Robin scheduling–– remember these algorithms.
        Memory? Paging + segmentation.
        Deadlocks happen when processes wait forever 😭.
        Prevention, detection, avoidance... security features (auth, access control, encryption).
        Examples: Windows, MacOS, Linux 🐧.
