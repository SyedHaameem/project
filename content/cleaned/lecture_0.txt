, ... welcome to today s class, . today we re talking about machine learning, ? ml is, aaah, basically a part of ai that lets computers learn from data. we have supervised... unsupervised... and reinforcement learning. supervised uses labeled daaata, unsupervised finds hidden patterns without labels, yeah. rl works on rewards penalties . we ll also talk about accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, etc. applications? spam detection, fraud detection, cars that drive themselves and on. clean data is important... like very important. also preprocessing: removing missing values, scaling, normalization.. blah blah. future trends: deep learning, generative ai, llms .
